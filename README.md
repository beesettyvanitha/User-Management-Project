This project is a User Management System built using Java Servlets, designed to demonstrate CRUD operations for managing user data. It includes features like user registration, updating user details, viewing a list of all users, and deleting users, with a simple and responsive web interface. The backend is powered by Java Servlets, while the frontend utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A relational database (e.g., MySQL) is used for data storage, and the application runs on a servlet container like Apache Tomcat. This project showcases key web development concepts and can be extended with features like role-based authentication or REST API integration.
